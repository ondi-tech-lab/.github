# 👋 Hi, I'm Ondi

🔒 Future IBM i (AS400) Recovery & Integrity Specialist  
🐧 Linux Infrastructure Enthusiast  
🛡️ Blue Team & Log Analysis Practitioner  

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Direction

I am currently focusing on mastering:

- IBM i / AS400 system architecture
- DB2 for i
- Journaling & Receiver Lifecycle Management
- Data Recovery & Failure Simulation
- Object-based OS integrity

---

## 🐧 Linux & Infrastructure Experience

Hands-on experience with:

- Linux server administration (Rocky Linux / Debian-based)
- Bash scripting & automation
- Self-managed 24/7 infrastructure environment
- Disk usage analysis & system troubleshooting
- Service monitoring & process investigation

I enjoy low-level system behavior analysis and infrastructure control.

## 🛡️ Blue Team & Log Analysis

Active in:

- Log investigation & anomaly detection
- Incident-style analysis (system & application logs)
- HackTheBox / CTF challenges (defensive & log-focused tracks)

Strong interest in:

- Root cause analysis
- Attack pattern detection
- System event correlation
- Security telemetry interpretation

I approach systems with a **forensic and defensive mindset**.

## 🔬 What I Like Solving

- Why did this system fail?
- What exactly changed before the incident?
- Can we recover without data loss?
- How do we prevent silent corruption?
- What do the logs really say?
