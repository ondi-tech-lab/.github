# 👋 Hi, I'm Ondi

Systems Engineer with 6+ years of backend development experience.  
Currently expanding into enterprise systems, automation, and security-focused engineering.

I work at the intersection of:

- Backend Development
- IBM i (AS400) Enterprise Systems
- Linux & Automation
- Security & Log Analysis

---

## 🚀 Background

Started as a backend web developer building and maintaining production systems using:

- PHP
- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- MS SQL Server
- REST APIs
- Production debugging & issue investigation

Over time, my interest shifted toward **how systems actually run in production**, not just how they are built.
